# Microbial Network Analysis Workflow ü¶†üìä

This repository contains R and Python scripts organized into modules to perform a comprehensive microbial association network (MAN) analysis, 
from raw data preprocessing to network comparisons and metadata correlations. Here, we preprocess abundance and metadata files, build MANs
using the [NetComi R package](https://github.com/stefpeschel/NetCoMi/), filter and analyze these networks, visualize them in Cytoscape, 
and correlate network modules with metadata variables.

---

## üöÄ Workflow Overview

The general workflow for analyzing MANs in this repository follows these steps:

1.  **Preprocessing**: Prepare raw abundance and metadata for analysis. 

2.  **Network Inference**: Construct microbial association networks.

3.  **Network Filtering**: Split networks based on various thresholds and remove singletons or low-connectivity nodes.

4.  **Threshold Analysis**: Evaluate network topological metrics across networks with thresholds and identify optimal networks 
based on modularity and average clsutering coefficient.

5.  **Network Visualization**: Generate interactive visualizations of networks in Cytoscape.

6.  **Network Analysis**: Perform network analysis using NetComi and custom Python scripts.

7.  **Metadata Correlation**: Investigate relationships between network modules and metadata variables.

8.  **Networks Comparison**: Compare network structures, overlaps, and clustering similarities.

## üìÅ Scripts & Their Purpose

Each subfolder within the `Scripts` directory contains specialized tools. For detailed usage instructions and parameters for individual scripts, refer to the `README.md` file located within each respective subfolder.

| Folder | Purpose | Outputs |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Preprocessing` | Initial data handling: parsing raw data into usable formats and exploratory data analysis (EDA). | Cleaned abundance, taxonomic, and metadata files, EDA plots. |
| `Network_inference` | Building microbial interaction networks with the **cclasso** method on **NetComi**. | `microNet` R objects and corresponding edgelist CSVs, often saved by network type and threshold. |
| `Threshold_analysis` | Calculating and visualizing topological metrics of networks across different thresholds. | CSV files with calculated network metrics, PNG/SVG plots illustrating metric trends, and node clustering data for "best" networks. |
| `Network_filtering` | Refining and cleaning inferred networks by applying thresholds and removing low-connectivity nodes. | Filtered `microNet` objects and cleaned edgelist CSVs (typically with `nosinglt` in the filename). |
| `Network_visualization` | Creating dynamic visualizations of networks in Cytoscape. | Networks imported and visually styled within a running Cytoscape instance, mapping node properties (e.g., degree, cluster) and edge properties (e.g., weight, sign). |
| `Network_analysis` | Advanced network analyses. | Various analytical results, potentially including centrality measures, multi-layer network structures, and other network-specific metrics. |
| `Metadata_correlation` | Correlating microbial community modules with sample metadata. | CSV reports of module-metadata correlations (including statistical tests and FDR correction), and corresponding plots. |
| `Networks_comparison` | Comparing different networks. | Metrics and reports on network overlap, unique features, and clustering similarities. |

For detailed instructions on running each script and understanding specific outputs, please refer to the individual `README.md` files located within each script subfolder (e.g., `Scripts/Network_filtering/README.md`).

## üì¶ Output Folders

The `Output` directory is structured to store results from various analysis stages:

* **`Best_nets`**: Stores information about optimal networks identified during threshold analysis. 
The **.rds** files were ommitted from this repo because of their large size, but they can be generated by running the scripts in the `Threshold_analysis` folder.

* **`EDA`**: Contains results from initial exploratory data analysis.

* **`Threshold_analysis`**: Stores calculated metrics and plots from threshold analysis.
